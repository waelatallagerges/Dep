:::note
If you do not see a video image of yourself, check the following points:
The camera on your device is:
- present (small lens at the top of the screen / an external webcam on the monitor),
- activated (on some laptops you can actively switch the webcam on/off),
- plugged in (only necessary for external webcams),
- installed (some devices require the camera to be installed first).

:::note
If you cannot transmit sound, check the following points:
The microphone on your device is:
- available (especially with desktop devices, a microphone is never actually integrated. Here you need an external microphone or headset, which you connect to the appropriate ports on your PC),
- activated (on some laptops with an integrated microphone or headsets there is a switch to activate / deactivate the microphone),
- plugged in (only necessary for external microphones),
- installed (on some old computers the microphone must be installed).
