On iOS all browsers share the same engine, Safari. As such all features and limitations on all iOS
browsers are those of Safari.

For a better mobile experience (background support, CallKit integration, etc.) we recommend using a
native app instead. We provide a [native iOS SDK](dev-guide-ios-sdk.).
