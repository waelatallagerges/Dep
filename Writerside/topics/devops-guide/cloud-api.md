The DEP  Meet Cloud API is a specification for services which can support the integration of DEP  Meet into other applications, for mapping conferences for dial-in support, and for supporting directory search and user invitations to conferences.

The swagger for these services is provided in [cloud-api.swagger](https://github.com/DEP /DEP -meet/blob/master/resources/cloud-api.swagger).
